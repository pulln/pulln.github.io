		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p class= "flavor">Europa was born in 1610 to parents Galieo and Jupiter. Some speculate Europa was discovered a day earlier, but whether out of malice or sheer inconsideration, Galieo did not acknowledge Europa's existence for a full day. NASA aims to rekindle our relationship with Europa so that we might resume the search for and study of potential alien aquatic life.</p>
		<p>Within our own oceans, we often discover new species of deep sea marine life. These creatures typically share the same squishy pressurized mutations suited for living in the deepest parts of our uncharted ocean. It would surely be interesting to learn what kind of life has evolved to live below the sub-zero surface of Europa.</p>

		<h2>Wendy's and you</h2>
		<p class="flavor">Fresh never frozen beef sounds innocuous enough, but in truth, it is one of the most destructive campaigns to ever ravage this Earth. Wendy's alone is not guilty for the ruminant plague on our planet, but rather, look toward the concerted effort by big money to deflect the global warming blame from the animal agriculture sector to the energy sector. It doesn't help that in a fast-paced apathetic world, the ethical argument against burger-consumption often comes up in a compassionate humanitarian context, when the issue is really an environmental one. Ruminants are a special kind of animal that don't just digest their food once. As you may be aware, a cow has four stomaches and each time food is digested, methane is produced and inevitably the animal flatulates. Sounds like a joke, but each cow releases an average of ~100kg of methane annually. At 1.5 billion cows and a greenhouse potency 23 times higher than Co2, we are looking at serious ozone deterioration. Fresh never frozen drives the demand for live ruminants up, and that is that last thing this planet needs.

		<h2>Sentient life or not</h2>
		<p class="flavor">Coral is the perfect example of a pillar in a marine-based ecosystem. It also happens to be one of the most fragile organisms on earth. Earth indigenous coral evolves according to the stressors of it's native environment, and until recently we only acknowledged the existence of tropical coral. Expeditions into deep arctic waters have opened our eyes to new coral traits that may prove vital in the future.

		<p class= "ktc">Until things get so incredibly bad on Earth, there won't be a sense of urgency to study the marginally unfavorable enviromental conditions of Earth-like planets. A drone journey to Europa via modern means is estimated at around 6 years and the mission has been sidebarred until 2020. Meaning if things go bad in 2021 we won't have potentially relevant data for another 5 years. That said, the ozone layer can take a beating. Even the most pessimistic enviromental scientists don't estimate its total degeneration for another 20-25 years. However, personally, I wouldn't mind knowing whether or not there is a record of life under 6 feet of ice.</p>
