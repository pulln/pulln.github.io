	<hr>
	<p>Europa was born in 1610 to parents Galieo and Jupiter. Some speculate Europa was discovered a day earlier, but whether out of malice or sheer inconsideration, Galieo did not acknowledge Europa's existence for a full day. NASA aims to rekindle our relationship with Europa so that we might resume the search for and study of potential alien aquatic life.</p>
