		<p class= "flavor">Europa was born in 1610 to parents Galieo and Jupiter. Some speculate Europa was discovered a day earlier, but whether out of malice or sheer inconsideration, Galieo did not acknowledge Europa's existence for a full day. NASA aims to rekindle our relationship with Europa so that we might resume the search for and study of potential alien aquatic life.</p>
		<p>Within our own oceans, we often discover new species of deep sea marine life. These creatures typically share the same squishy pressurized mutations suited for living in the deepest parts of our uncharted ocean. It would surely be interesting to learn what kind of life has evolved to live below the sub-zero surface of Europa.</p>

		<p class= "ktc">Until things get so incredibly bad on Earth, there won't be a sense of urgency to study the marginally unfavorable enviromental conditions of Earth-like planets. A drone journey to Europa via modern means is estimated at around 6 years and the mission has been sidebarred until 2020. Meaning if things go bad in 2021 we won't have potentially relevant data for another 5 years. That said, the ozone layer can take a beating. Even the most pessimistic enviromental scientists don't estimate its total degeneration for another 20-25 years. However, personally, I wouldn't mind knowing whether or not there is a record of life under 6 feet of ice.</p>
